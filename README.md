# Cinder
## Inspiration
We were inspired by Tinder swipe animation and other travel planning mobile application. By combining the animation and the travel planning aspects, users can choose to save their liked cities for their next trips!
## What it does
Cinder will recommend cities that users might be interested in. The recommended cities will be displayed as card, and they can swipe left or right to save them for their next vacations. Once they have found the city that they want to plan for their upcoming trip, Cinder will display lists of the city's top activities, restaurants and hotels.
## How we built it
Figma to draft out ideas, designs, and to build a prototype. Swift and Xcode for iOS mobile application development.
## Challenges we ran into
The time zone differences have made it difficult for us to collaborate together, and we didn't have much coding experience with Swift.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Swipe animation just like Tinder!
- Beautiful design.
- Floating and expandable button!
## What we learned

## What's next for Cinder
